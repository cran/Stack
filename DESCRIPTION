Description: Stacks rectangular datasets on top of each other, possibly
        performing several type coercions along the way. For large
        datasets, optionally use the ff package. Provides an aggressive
        version of ffbase::compact for data that may appear be
        real-typed but is in fact int/short/byte. For many purposes
        plyr::rbind.fill may be more appropriate, but for some kinds of
        survey data, the rules here work better.
